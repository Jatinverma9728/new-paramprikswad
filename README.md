> "Paramprik Swad" built using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. The site uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with a warm color scheme featuring amber and orange gradients, and custom fonts (Inter for body text and Playfair Display for headings) that give it an elegant look.

The application uses Zustand for state management, handling user sessions, shopping cart, and wishlist functionality. The cart and wishlist data persist in the browser's localStorage. The site is internationalized using i18next, suggesting it supports multiple languages. The routing is handled by React Router with several key pages including Home, Products, Cart, Wishlist, Login, Contact, About, and Shipping Policy.

The project is set up as a modern web application using Vite as the build tool and includes various development tools like ESLint and TypeScript for code quality. It also incorporates Three.js (via React Three Fiber and Drei), suggesting there might be some 3D elements or animations on the site. The structure follows a well-organized pattern with separate directories for components, pages, providers, and store management. Looking at the public/images folder, it appears to be focused on selling food products, particularly items like ghee and other traditional food items.
